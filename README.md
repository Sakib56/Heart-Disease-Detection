# Heart-Disease-Detection
This is my approach at implementing a **Support Vector Machine** and applying it to the **Heart Disease dataset**, provided by the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Heart+Disease)

Unlike many of my other machine learning projects to date, I will not be implementing SVM from scratch. Instead I will be using the popular **Scikit Learn** library. This can be installed by running ```pip install -U scikit-learn``` via terminal.
